sentence=Particle library for controlling I2C 7 Segment LED Displays
paragraph=This library provides many functions to communicate with 7 Segment LED display modules. Functions such as clear, set brightness, move cursor, and print are available. This library only works with 7 segment LED displays that use the AMS AS1115 chip. This chip uses the I2C communication protocol. The library will work with 7 Segment displays up to 8 digits wide. See the README file for more details. A demo program (in the examples folder) demonstrates all of the functions in this library.
